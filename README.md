<p>Hello✨ !! everyone i have created my 45-assignments but in my repo there is only 43 because :</br>
in our first exercise we just have to install vs.code and node.js that's why i din't make first assignment <br/>
and in exercise seven and exercise eight  both are same so this is the reason why i don't make another folder i just create only one folder and do work </br>

</p>
<h2>Language used 🎯</h2>
<p>I create my 45-assignment with the help of <b>Node.js,Typescript</b></p>
